# NFT Swap Shop

## Overview

The NFT Swap Shop is a smart contract built on Solidity for facilitating simple, secure, and trustless swaps of NFTs between two parties. This initial version is designed with modularity in mind, enabling future expansion and enhancement. It allows for the basic functionality of swapping NFTs between two users, with a structure that supports easy integration of more complex features in the future.

## Features

- **Simple NFT Swap:** Users can propose and accept swaps of NFTs with each other. Both parties must confirm the swap before it is finalised, ensuring that the exchange is consensual.
- **Secure Transactions:** NFTs are held securely in the contract during the swap process and are only released when both parties have confirmed the swap.
- **Modular Design:** The contract is built with a focus on future expandability. It includes hooks for additional logic, making it easy to extend the contract with more complex features without altering the core functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Propose a Swap:** A user proposes a swap by transferring their NFT to the contract. This action locks the NFT until the swap is completed or cancelled.
2. **Accept a Swap:** Another user can accept the swap by transferring their NFT to the contract. Both NFTs are now locked in the contract.
3. **Confirm or Cancel:** Either party can confirm the swap, indicating they are ready to proceed. If both parties confirm, the NFTs are swapped and transferred to their new owners. Alternatively, either party can cancel the swap if both parties haven't confirmed yet.
4. **Finalisation:** Once both parties have confirmed, the NFTs are swapped and each user can withdraw their new NFT from the contract.

## Future Expansions

This core contract is designed to serve as the foundation for a more comprehensive NFT swap platform. The following features are planned for future releases:

### 1. **Swapping Multiple NFTs and Tokens (Bags of Assets)**
   - Support for swapping multiple NFTs at once, as well as integrating ERC20 tokens into the swap.
   - Users will be able to create and accept "bags" of assets, combining various NFTs and tokens into a single swap.

### 2. **Real-World Assets (RWA) Support**
   - Integration with real-world assets tokenised as NFTs.
   - Involves an inspector role who can verify and hold the assets before finalising the swap. This is crucial for swaps involving high-value physical items or complex conditions.

### 3. **Inspector and Escrow Modules**
   - An inspector module allowing a trusted third party to verify and approve the assets before finalisation.
   - Escrow functionality to hold additional assets, such as ERC20 tokens, during complex swaps, ensuring that both parties fulfil all obligations before the exchange is completed.

### 4. **Timeout and Dispute Resolution**
   - Implementation of timeout mechanisms to automatically cancel swaps if they are not confirmed within a specified period.
   - A dispute resolution mechanism for handling conflicts, potentially involving multiple inspectors or an arbitration process.

## Contributing

This project is still in its early stages, and contributions are welcome! Whether it’s for core improvements, future feature implementations, or UI integration, we’d love to have your help in making this platform more robust and versatile.
